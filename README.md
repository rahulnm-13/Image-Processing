# Image-Processing and Objects-Identification
Storing the data of a person's face in the form of a collection of matrices of pixels value. Then using that data and Classification algorithms of Machine Learning to recognize the person's face and hence, helping in face identification. This can be extended to objects identification as well which can be of high importance in the study of autonomous vehicles.
